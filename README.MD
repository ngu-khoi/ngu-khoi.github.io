this is a react app and completely over-engineered. i was just practicing some css and react.

i used nextjs and typescript.


## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```


To build static files for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Random Notes
- The project card is a 16:9 aspect ratio. Recommended size is 800px wide and 450px tall.
- If you find that 800x450 is too large and impacts performance, you could scale down to 600x338 or even 400x225.
